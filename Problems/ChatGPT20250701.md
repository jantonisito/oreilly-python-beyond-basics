### ðŸ§  Why Look for `<input>` Instead of `<button>`?

#### 1. **HTML Forms Have Multiple Ways to Submit**

In HTML, a "button" that submits a form can be either of these:

```html
<input type="submit" value="Search">
<!-- OR -->
<button type="submit">Search</button>
```

So:

* `<input type="submit">` is **older** and still widely used, especially in minimalist or legacy code.
* `<button>` is **newer** and more flexible (you can nest elements inside it, like icons or spans).

#### 2. **If You Find No `<button>`, Look for Form Inputs**

Since buttons often submit forms, try:

```html
<form> ... </form>
```

Inside that, look for:

```html
<input type="submit">
```

So the logic becomes:

> *"If there's no `<button>`, maybe theyâ€™re using `<input type='submit'>`."*
> It's especially common in older or performance-optimized pages (like Googleâ€™s homepage).

### ðŸ›  Tip for Soup Users: General Search for "Clickable" Elements

If youâ€™re unsure, you can write a broader query:

```python
soup.find_all(lambda tag: tag.name in ['button', 'input'] and tag.get('type') == 'submit')
```

This will catch *both* cases.
